## What is Netzo?

Netzo is a platform and batteries-included meta-framework for Deno Fresh. It
offers a collection of modules and opinionated best practices, empowering
developers to build web apps faster without sacrificing flexibility.

- **Platform:** a cloud platform to deploy, manage, and scale your apps.
- **Framework:** built on **Deno Fresh**, a next-gen web framework designed for
  rapid development.

## Why Netzo?

> "Low-code tools make the first 60% easy, and the remaining 40% impossible."

Custom business app development has challenges. Traditional development is
complex and time-consuming. In business software not only is flexibility but
speed and efficiency are paramount. Our goal is to provide full-code flexibility
at no-code speeds boosting developer productivity and enabling them to build
apps 10x faster.

## Main Features

- **Authentication:** built-in user management and role-based access control
  (RBAC).
- **Database:** built-in **Deno KV** database, a fast, reliable, and secure
  key-value database.
- **Components:** beautifully designed, accessible, and customizable components
  based on [`shadcn/ui`](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- **Integrations:** a growing list of plug-and-play integrations for popular
  APIs and Databases.
- **CSS/Styling:** built-in, pre-defined themes powered by **UnoCSS**, an
  instant, on-demand atomic CSS engine.
- **CLI:** command-line interface (CLI) to help you develop and deploy Netzo
  applications.
